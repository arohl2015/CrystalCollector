# unit-4-game

The project for this week was to create a Crystal Collector game using JavaScript and JQuery.

The game instructions are as follows:

* Displaying 4 crystals as buttons on the page.
* Showing the player a random number at the start of the game.
* Players clicking on a crystal, with each crystal adding a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
* The player winning if their total score matches the random number shown at the beginning of the game and losing if their score exceeds the random number. The random number will change with every new game and resets the score (and game counter) to zero.
â€‹* The game will restart everytime, win or lose.
