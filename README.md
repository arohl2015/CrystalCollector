# unit-4-game

The project for this week was to create a Crystal Collector game using the skills learned in class up until this point. You can access my game here: https://arohl2015.github.io/unit-4-game/

# How to Play:

* A random number is generated on the page for the player to match (between 19-120).
* Four gems are on the page, each randomly assigned values from 1-12.
* Each time the player clicks on a button, the hidden value of the gem is added to the player score.
* If the player matches the random score they win; if they go over, they lose.
* After the player wins or loses, the game is restarted and a new random number and gem values are assigned.

# Built Using:
